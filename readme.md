# LOWFISH:
- compiled, statically typed language
- fast compiler
- compiled to x86 intel assembly (will not work on ARM chips)
# Features:
Basically a simpler version of C but with Containers. Containers are like namespaces but without any scope. A container only effects how the code can be imported.
