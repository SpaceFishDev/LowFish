# Lowfish
Lowfish is a low level compiled programming language.

## Features
- types that make sense ie 'i32' or 'ptr32'
- open source, so if you have a complaint and I'm too slow, fix it.
- other stuff
- basically just C but I like C.

### Hello world.
```c
extern("printf")
i32 main()
{
	printf("Hello, World");
}
```
